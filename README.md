## What's Dub?

Dub is a musical genre characterized by exaggerated reverb, delay, and bass; remixing of existing songs; and a slowed-down, "relaxed" feel.

## What's the history?

As you saw, dub's figureheads also worked on countless Jamaican reggae records, and used those to make their own dub-ed records.

The focus of dub on taking out vocals to instead push the bass and drums was imitated by quite a few musicians, such as those in drum-n-bass (yes, that's a real genre!), and those who worked on electronic music that took over the coming decases.

Additionally, the use of new technologies to create these futuristic sounds led way to music sounding weirder. Not musically, but sonically.

## Conclusion

It's influenced/created quite a few genres too:

- ~Dub~step
- Dancehall
- Drum and bass
- Hip hop
- Ska
